# Brightly.AI
Description: To be able to implement effective environmental policies, it is critical to first understand how the environment is being used (e.g. industry, farming, forest). In many areas of the world, official data is lacking, meaning it is incredibly difficult to assess the true impact and thus to plan ahead.

Due to the increasing amount of satellite data, as well as improvements in computer vision, researchers have recently started to use AI to automatically determine land usage from space.


# Challenge

- Build a model that accurately predicts land usage from satellite image data using the [EuroSAT](https://github.com/phelber/EuroSAT) dataset
- Provide a compelling demo to showcase how the model works on a region of the world where land usage data is lacking â€“ showing a downstream use case of land usage prediction!
- Provide a business plan & market analysis to turn this prototype into a startup
